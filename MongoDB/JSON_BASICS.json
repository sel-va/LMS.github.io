JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. It is easy to read and write for both humans and machines. It is used to transmit data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML.

Here are the key features of JSON:
	Data is represented in key/value pairs.
	Data is separated by commas.
	Curly braces hold objects.
	Square brackets hold arrays.
	Here is an overview of how to work with JSON:

To create a JSON object, start with an opening curly brace, followed by the name and value of each key, separated by a colon, and end with a closing curly brace. For example:

	{
	  "name": "John",
	  "age": 30,
	  "city": "New York"
	}

To create a JSON array, start with an opening square bracket, followed by the values of each item separated by commas, and end with a closing square bracket. 
For example:
		[  "apple",  "banana",  "cherry"]

To parse JSON, you can use the built-in JSON.parse() method in JavaScript. This method takes a JSON string and returns a JavaScript object. For example:
		var jsonText = '{"name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}';
		var jsonObj = JSON.parse(jsonText);


To stringify a JavaScript object to JSON, you can use the built-in JSON.stringify() method. This method takes a JavaScript object and returns a JSON string. For example:
	var jsonObj = { name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" };
	var jsonText = JSON.stringify(jsonObj);

In addition to simple objects and arrays, JSON can be used to represent more complex data structures, such as nested objects and arrays, and objects with varying keys.

JSON is widely used in web development and data exchange between applications. It is supported by many programming languages and is considered a standard for web APIs.
